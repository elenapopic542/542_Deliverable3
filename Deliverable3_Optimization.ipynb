    "\"A new airline has decided to join the market. It is considering offering flights out of Phoenix, AZ, and would initially like to travel to three different locations: San Diego, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. The distances of each round-trip flight going out of Phoenix are (approximately): 720 miles, 1500 miles, and 1140 miles, respectively. The company would like to use the slogan, \"the average price per flight is never more than $200.\" As for costs, it anticipates flights to San Diego will run about 10 percent of airfare. Similarly, San Francisco will run 12 percent and Las Vegas will run 14 percent of airfare. The company wants to ensure that the overall average cost is no more than 10 percent of earned airfare. Recent market research allows the company to conclude that it could probably sell about 1900 San Diego tickets, 700 San Francisco tickets, and 1000 Las Vegas ticket. Under these conditions and assuming that all tickets sold are round-trip flights, how much should the company charge per ticket in order to maximize its total revenue?\""
